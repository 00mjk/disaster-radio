undervoltage lockout threshold is 3.1 to 4.4, minimum input voltage is 4.5V

mppt set voltage on CN3971 module, set by 
	Vmppt = 1.205 x (1 + R1 / R2) (according to module to silkscreen)
	note that (R3 is R1, R4 is R2) as specified in cn3791 datasheet
easy calculation with R2 = 10K
	R1 = ((Vmppt / 1.205) - 1) * 10K
	e.g for 6V,  Vmppt R1 = 39.8KOhms (closes common value is 39kohm)

current limit 
	Ich = 120mV / R5 (note R5 is Rcs in datasheet, it is the very big resistor)
	R5 = 0.04 Ohms
	Ich = 3A 
	this seems way, way to high
